The dataset includes information on 506 census housing tracts in the Boston area. The goal is to predict the median house price in new tracts based on information such as crime rate, pollution, and number of rooms. The dataset contains 13 predictors, and the outcome variable is the median house price (MEDV).

Fitted a multiple linear regression model to the median house price (MEDV) as a function of CRIM, CHAS, and RM. Wrote the equation for predicting the
median house price from the predictors in the model.

Used the estimated regression model to determine median house price which is predicted for a tract in the Boston area that does not bound the Charles River, has a
crime rate of 0.1, and where the average number of rooms per house is 6.

Reduced the number of predictors and computed the correlation table for the 12 numerical predictors and searched for highly correlated pairs. These have potential redundancy and can cause multicollinearity and identified which ones to remove based on the table.
